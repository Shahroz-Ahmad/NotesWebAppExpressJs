There’s a quiet kind of emptiness where you used to be, a space that no one can fill, no matter how many faces come and go. It’s not just the absence of your voice or your laugh; it’s the way the air feels thinner, like something vital is missing, and no matter how hard I try to breathe through it, I can never quite get enough. Every room feels incomplete, like the corners hold echoes of the person I used to be when you were here, when your presence made everything feel less fragile. I tell myself it’s just time, that eventually I’ll learn to live with the space you left, but every day feels like a reminder that there’s a piece of me, of us, that will never return.
