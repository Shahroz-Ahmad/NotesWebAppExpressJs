There was something in the way you looked at me, something that made me feel like I was seen, really seen—more than just the person I pretended to be, more than just the sum of my mistakes and fears. You had this way of looking at me like you knew everything, the quiet pieces of my soul I never shared with anyone, and somehow, you accepted them without hesitation. It wasn’t just love, it was understanding—a deep knowing that felt like it had been there all along, even before we met. And now, without you, I find myself lost, wandering through days that feel too long, searching for that same clarity in the eyes of strangers, but it’s never the same. Nobody sees me like you did. Nobody ever will. I can’t help but ache for the way you could look at me and make me feel like I was whole, like I wasn’t broken. Now, I’m just a shadow of who I was, missing the one person who truly understood me.
