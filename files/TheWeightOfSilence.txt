There’s a kind of heaviness in silence, a weight that presses on my chest, suffocating and all-encompassing. It’s the silence that falls between us now, the quiet where words used to live, where laughter and comfort used to fill the air. Now, it’s just space—empty and cold—and I can’t find the strength to bridge the gap. I thought silence would be easier to bear, but it’s unbearable in its own way. It’s the silence after every argument, after every goodbye we never spoke aloud. It’s the silence that follows me through my days, a constant reminder of the things we never said and the love we let slip away without ever really acknowledging it. In this silence, I realize how much of me is missing, how much of us is buried beneath it, and how we never really learned how to fill the quiet.
