We pass a cigarette back and forth on the balcony of the bar, and I mention your name, careful to make it sound like it slipped out, like it didn’t mean anything. I hope someone catches it, asks the questions I’ve been wanting to answer. "What was she like? Was she good to you? Did she know you loved her? Would she have stayed if you had said the right words?" And maybe, if I’m lucky, someone will stop pretending they don’t notice the way my hands tighten around the railing, the way I keep glancing down like I’m looking for something I lost. Maybe they’ll press me and ask me to talk about the nights when her laughter felt like it could light up a whole room. About the mornings when she’d look at me, half-asleep, and somehow make me feel like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. What I really want—what I’m afraid to admit—is that someone will put a hand on my shoulder, steady and sure, and tell me it’s okay. That I don’t have to bury it in small talk or jokes that don’t land. That I don’t have to pretend I don’t still love her. That it’s okay to tell the truth about the way her eyes knew me, like she could see every version of who I was and still chose me, even when I didn’t deserve it.
