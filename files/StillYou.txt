We stand at the edge of everything, and I let your name slip, careful to sound indifferent, like it doesn't hold the weight of all the things I never said. I try to make it sound casual, but I feel the way my voice falters, the way my hands still remember the way yours used to fit. Maybe someone will ask the questions I’ve been holding onto for too long. “What was she like?” they’ll ask, and I’ll want to say everything—about the way your eyes made me feel seen, the way your smile could erase all the noise around us. I’ll want to say how I never really knew how to love you the way you deserved, how I still wonder if I could have held on tighter, said the right words. But instead, I stay quiet, watching the smoke curl up and fade into the night, wishing someone would see through the silence. Wishing someone would ask if I still love you, and I wouldn’t have to hide the truth. That it’s still you, in every moment, in everything I never said out loud.
