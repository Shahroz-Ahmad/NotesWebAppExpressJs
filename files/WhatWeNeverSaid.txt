There were words that stayed lodged in my chest, things I wanted to say to you but never found the courage for. Things like how much I loved you in ways that no sentence could capture, how I never understood the depth of my feelings until it was too late to express them. I wish I had told you, the way your presence made everything else seem trivial, how the world felt like it made sense when I was with you. But instead, I held those words inside, kept them buried beneath layers of fear, pride, and uncertainty. Now, I’m left with an empty space where my heart used to beat in rhythm with yours, and all I can do is wonder if you knew, deep down, just how much you meant to me. We’ll never know what could’ve been if I had spoken the truth. We’ll never know what we never said.
