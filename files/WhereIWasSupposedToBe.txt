I can still feel it—the quiet certainty that came with waking up next to you, when everything around us faded and it was just us, as if the world had stopped spinning long enough for me to realize that this was exactly where I was supposed to be. Those mornings, when you’d look at me with sleep in your eyes and a half-smile on your lips, it felt like I had found a place in time where nothing else mattered, where the chaos and noise of life could be paused for just a moment. I never knew it at the time, but now I see that I was holding something I couldn’t keep—something so simple, yet so perfect, that I forgot to cherish it while I had the chance. Now, I wonder if I’ll ever feel that way again, or if I’ll just be chasing shadows of a moment that I didn’t understand until it was already gone.
