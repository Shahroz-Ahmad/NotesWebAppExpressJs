There are things we never say, truths that stay hidden beneath layers of words we’re too afraid to speak. We bury them deep, thinking they’ll stay forgotten, but they only grow heavier, filling the spaces between us with their weight. The truth is, I’ve always loved you in a way that words can’t express, but I was too scared to admit it, too scared to let myself believe you felt the same. We buried that truth, buried all the things we never gave voice to, and now it haunts me, lingering in every glance and every unsaid word. We thought silence would protect us, that keeping everything locked away would make it easier, but now, all that’s left is regret, and the painful realization that we let the most important truth of all remain buried, never to see the light.
